The Usoilc stands for United Standard Orthography for the Igbo Language Cluster &amp;  is of  independent coinage and is a fairly new  orthography at the time this project page  is being put up. Project pages here will  use the space to host the monograph of the Usoilc project (for interested members  of the public).
