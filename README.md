# USOILC
The Usoilc stands for United Standard Orthography for the Igbo Language Cluster &amp;  is of  independent coinage and is a fairly new  orthography at the time this project page  is being put up. Project pages here will  use the space to host the monograph of the Usoilc project (for interested members  of the public).  

To see this monograph (corpus) as it might be presented over the regular web, through a regular website:

visit: https://bafybeibl6qbgvc3gvl32xmfqmjlf6msvkevscrbipb24jloj64lopclyuq.ipfs.w3s.link

One feature of the transcoded text is that page 1 in the transcoded text is page 1 in the monograph and that order (or page parity) is kept until after the final page 26 of the monograph (which is page 33 of the transcoded text) where the 'Afterword' section begins.  The Afterword provides justification for the existence of the transcoded text and this project. Be sure to study the Wiki pages here to learn about some history and ways to use the files here.  Thanks for visiting.
